# Clustering Music into Genres


## Introduction

In this project, I am given a sample music data, and we have to cluster them into different genres.

This project demonstrates various python libraries to achieve this.

## 1. Data Cleaning

Firstly, Data is cleaned. As this is already mostly cleaned data, we don't have to perform much cleaning.

## 2. K Means Clustering

In this, we divide the dataset into **7** clusters using K means clustering.

Here is how it looks visually

The left plot shows the complete dataset whereas the right one shows the dataset after clustering. Each cluster is represented by a unique color

## 3. Agglomerative Clustering

In this, we form cluster of each element one by one in bottom up manner. At each step, we combine most similar or least distant clusters.
